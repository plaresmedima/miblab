*******
Mission
*******

To accelerate the uptake of medical imaging biomarkers in research, drug 
development and clinical practice.


********
Approach
********

We will achieve our mission by a commitment to share resources freely, 
with robust software architectures and user interfaces that are transparent 
and consistent across all of *miblab*'s resources. 

Our aim is to maximise the opportunities for reuse of data, software and 
measurement protocols. This will accelerate uptake of medical imaging 
biomarkers by improving both the efficiency and reproducibility of research 
and development.


*********
Licensing
*********

*miblab* is rooted in public-private partnerships and recognises that 
efficient research, development and deployment of medical imaging biomarkers 
benefits from frictionless collaboration between sectors. 

*miblab*'s licensing approach reflects this principle and allows users to 
share and adapt its resources with minimal restrictions, including for 
commercial use:

- All *miblab* software is distributed under the 
  `Apache 2.0 license <https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_.

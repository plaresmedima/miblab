****
Who?
****

*miblab* is based in the 
`medical imaging group <https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/smph/research/themes/imaging>`_ 
at the University of Sheffield, UK. Resources shared on these pages are 
developed in collaboration with other groups in the private and 
public sector [see :ref:`about <about>`].


*******
Mission
*******

To promote the uptake of medical imaging biomarkers in research, drug 
development and clinical practice.


********
Approach
********

We are committed to sharing our resources freely, 
with robust software architectures and user interfaces that are transparent 
and consistent across all of *miblab*'s resources. 

Our aim is to maximise the opportunities for reuse of data, software and 
measurement protocols - with a view of improving the efficiency and 
reproducibility of research, development and deployment of medical imaging biomarkers.


*********
Licensing
*********

*miblab* is rooted in public-private partnerships and recognises that 
efficient research, development and deployment of medical imaging biomarkers 
benefits from frictionless collaboration between sectors. 

*miblab*'s licensing approach reflects this principle and allows users to 
share and adapt its resources with minimal restrictions, including for 
commercial use:

- All *miblab* software is distributed under the 
  `Apache 2.0 license <https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_.
